# GDSC RVIST Event and Group Chat App

Welcome to the GDSC RVIST Event and Group Chat App repository! This Flutter-based mobile application is designed to enhance communication and engagement within our GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) community at Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology. It provides a platform for members to stay up-to-date with club events and participate in group discussions with ease.

## Features

- **Event Management:** Keep track of upcoming GDSC RVIST events, workshops, and meetups right from your mobile device. Get event details, RSVP, and set reminders so you never miss an exciting opportunity to learn and network.

- **Group Chat:** Connect with fellow GDSC members through real-time group chat functionality. Share ideas, collaborate on projects, and stay in touch with the vibrant tech community at RVIST.

- **Firebase Integration:** We leverage Firebase, a powerful backend platform, to ensure seamless real-time communication, authentication, and data storage. Firebase provides a secure and scalable foundation for our app.

- **User Authentication:** Members can securely sign in and register using Firebase Authentication. Your data and interactions are kept private and accessible only to verified GDSC RVIST members.
